## About The Project

![Screen Shot](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/9c/8c/db/9c8cdbb2bd7b637edd5b3a767b74153a.gif)

This project is a Java-based application simulating a Car Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) system. It is designed to manage car and user data, offering different user roles like customers, admins, and roots, each with specific privileges. The project integrates a SQLite database to persistently store and manage data, and utilizes Maven for dependency management.

## ðŸ’¡Detailed INFO:

The Car DMV System serves as a comprehensive platform for handling vehicle-related administrative tasks. Key features and functionalities include:

- **User Authentication**: Different user roles (customer, admin, root) with secure login functionalities.
- **Data Management**: Allows admins and root users to add, modify, and delete customer and car records.
- **Car Management**: Customers can view and manage their car details, such as make, model, year, color, and more.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: The system implements role-based access control to segregate duties and permissions among different types of users.
- **Database Integration**: Uses SQLite for efficient data storage and retrieval, ensuring data persistence and integrity.
- **Maven Support**: The project is built and managed with Maven, simplifying dependency management and project compilation.
- **User Interface**: Includes a user-friendly interface for easy navigation and operation of the system.

This system is ideal for educational purposes, illustrating how a real-world application might handle user roles and data management, and serves as an excellent example of integrating Java with a database and Maven.

## Built With

For this project, Java was the primary language used, especially for developing the graphical user interface (GUI) components. Java's robustness and versatility make it an ideal choice for creating interactive and user-friendly applications. Additionally, Maven was used as a build tool for managing dependencies, and SQLite for database management, ensuring efficient data storage and retrieval.

</p>

For this project, I used both C lang and Java. The C code is mainly for me as I like the language and I want to use it. As for Java, I used it to provide a GUI for each code.

## Getting Started

Getting started with this repository is very simple. You can just navigate to the section you'd like to check out and you'll find documentation for each algorithm in its specific file. Each topic will have a java joint GUI program.

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK): The application is built using Java, thus requiring JDK to be installed on your system.
- Maven: Used for managing project dependencies.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yousinator/dmv-system.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory and use Maven to compile the project:

```sh
mvn compile
```

3. Run the application:

```sh
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=com.yousinator.Main
```

## Usage

The Car DMV System allows users to perform the following actions:

- **Customers**: View and manage their car details.
- **Admins**: Manage customer data, including adding, removing, or updating customer and car information.
- **Root**: Has all admin privileges, plus managing admin users.
